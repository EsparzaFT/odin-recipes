<!-- This is my first proyect :)

"In this project, I implemented the following HTML elements:

Links: <a> tags with href attributes.

Lists: <ul> (unordered) and <ol> (ordered) with nested <li> items.

Images: <img> tags with src and alt attributes.
For version control, I used Git commands (git add, git commit, etc.)." -->
